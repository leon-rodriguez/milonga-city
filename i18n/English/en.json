  "aboutMilongasSecondBody": "Explore the multifaceted world of Tango and Milonga. In the vibrant Tango culture, ‘Milonga’ carries multiple meanings. It’s not just an event where the passionate Tango dance unfolds, but also a rhythmic musical style that’s typically faster than Tango. Moreover, ‘Milonga’ is the very venue where enthusiasts gather to dance. Frequent attendees, deeply engaged in the dance, are known as ‘Milonguero’ for men and ‘Milonguera’ for women",
  "aboutMilongasThirdTitle": "The Milonga and its codes",
  "aboutMilongasThirdBody": "Dive into the World of Tango and Milonga, where a single venue transforms to host different ‘milongas’, each offering a unique atmosphere and experience. Depending on the organizer and the day, each milonga varies in formality, attendee age, dancer skill level, and its welcoming nature to newcomers. A key part of milonga etiquette is the ‘cabeceo’, a non-verbal invitation to dance used predominantly in traditional milongas.",
